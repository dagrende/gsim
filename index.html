    <h1>Gsim - g-code simulator</h1>
    <p>Simulates a milling machine running g-code. You can specify a workpiece size, a number of end-mills of varous diameter and the g-code. Then run or single-step the g-code instructions and see the mill digging into the piece.
    	<br>Rotate the workpiece with the left mouse button (three-fingers on Mac) and zoom with the mouse-wheel (two-fingers on Mac).</p>

    <p>The window should look like this:</p>
